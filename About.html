          <h3>Gameplay</h4>
          <p>
          Distant Horizon is a game about flying a trading spaceship in a realistic universe.
          It is hard science-fiction; the future of Distant Horizon requires no massive leaps in
          technology. What is represented is one of humanity's possible futures. Many space games
          seem to use atmospheric, airplane physics. Others use naval combat models. Distant Horizon
          is an attempt to demonstrate what realistic space travel would really be like, and to show that you
          don't have to diverge from reality for interesting space gameplay to emerge. 
          Compared to the exciting futures presented in science-fiction,
          the true possibilities of our future sometimes seem dull. Distant Horizon is an attempt
          to demonstrate that the true future will be just as exciting as the fictional.

          <h3>World</h4>
          <p>
          Distant Horizon is set in the fictional Regalis Deep, a cluster of six star systems that slowly orbit
          each other. This region of space was colonized by human generation ships departing from earth around 
          2700. Minimal contact has been had with Earth since that time. No sentient aliens are known to exist;
          while Regalis Deep features two naturally habitable planets, on neither has any life evolved higher
          intelligence. Humans have colonized these two worlds and have terraformed many more. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The planets of Regalis Deep are close enough together to allow travel between them to take place
          in weeks or months. This has allowed interplanetary trade to develop, and the space-lanes between
          planets are navigated by an active merchant fleet.
          </p>
          <p>
          The colonization ships dispatched to Regalis were primarily funded by the Federated States of
          North America, the People's Republic of Greater China, and the Union of South Asian Nations.
          While a few planets have achieved internal planetwide government, no stable interplanetary
          government has emerged. A few attempts have been made, but because communication between planets
          takes weeks at best, only very loose alliances can be formed. While some governments are more
          powerful than others, no single nation is dominant.
