          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
          This is a game about flying a trading spaceship in a realistic universe.
          It is hard science-fiction: the future of Distant Horizon requires no massive leaps in
          technology. The game world represents one of humanity's possible futures. Many space games
          use atmospheric airplane physics for flight. Others use naval models. Distant Horizon uses
		  a true spaceflight model; itis an attempt to demonstrate what realistic space travel would
		  be like, and to show that you don't have to diverge from reality for interesting space 
		  gameplay to emerge. Compared to the exciting futures presented in science-fiction, the
		  true possibilities of our future sometimes seem dull. Distant Horizon is an attempt to
		  demonstrate that the true futuremay be just as exciting as the fictional.

          <h3>World</h3>
          <p>
          Distant Horizon is set in Regalis Deep (TIC 168789840), a rare hextuple star system.
          This region of space was colonized by human generation ships departing from earth in 
          2712. Minimal contact has been had with Earth since that time. No sentient aliens are known to exist;
          while two worlds in Regalis Deep have native silicon-based life, neither developed any life with 
          human-level intelligence. Humans have colonized these two worlds and have terraformed many more. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The planets of Regalis Deep are close enough together to allow travel between them to take place
          in weeks or months. This has allowed interplanetary trade to develop, and the space-lanes between
          planets are navigated by an active merchant fleet.
          </p>
          <p>
          The colonization ships dispatched to Regalis were primarily funded by the Federated States of
          North America (FSA), the People's Republic of East Asia (P.R.E.A.), and the Union of South Asian Nations (SAN).
          While a few planets have stable planetwide governments, no stable interplanetary government has emerged.
		  A few governments have attempted to rule several worlds at once, but because communication between planets
          takes weeks at best, only loose alliances can be formed. While some governments are more
          powerful than others, no single nation currently holds hegemony over the others.

          <p>
          The game client is written in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a>, 
          compiling to WebAssembly, with a multiplayer server written in Kotlin. A small web server 
          application, written in Python/Flask, serves this static site and load balances between servers.
